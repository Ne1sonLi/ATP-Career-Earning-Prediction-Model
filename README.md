##Introduction
For our project we will analyze player stats for the Top 500 tennis players. Tennis is a racket sport played on courts everywhere. Some major tournaments include Wimbledon, US Open, Australian Open, and French Open. Our dataset contains a variety of information including the playerâ€™s age, handedness, name, height, seasons, etc.

In this project, we aim to answer the following question:

##Can you predict a tennis player's career earnings based on their profile?

We believe that this question is important for sports agents and tennis players so they have a greater ability to predict their future earnings. Sports agents are paid based on how much their clients (the athletes) make, so it would be very beneficial for them to have some ability to predict this amount. It will also be useful for players to be able to predict their future earnings and determine what factors have a large impact on their earnings. If they understand what factors have the biggest impact on their earnings they will be able to set goals for themselves and be set up for monetary success.
