    "For our project we will analyze player stats for the Top 500 tennis players. Tennis is a racket sport played on courts throughout the world, but is particularly popular in Europe. Some major tournaments include Wimbledon, the US Open, the Australian Open, and the French Open. Our dataset contains a wide array of information on these players such as age, handedness, name, height, year turned pro, seasons, played, titles won, best season, etc.\n",

    "* Prize money\n",

    "Since all the variables are quantitative, we will use the K-nearest neighbors regression model to analyze the data. The data will be split with 75% in the training set. All predictors will be standardized (scaled and centered) and the number of neighbors will be determined through cross validation. The training data will be split into five equal portions and the number of neighbors used in the final model will correspond with the smallest estimated error from the cross validation tests. The model will be retrained using the ideal number of neighbors on the training set and evaluated by determining its standard error on the testing set. Furthermore, each predictor will undergo this process on its own to determine whether adding more predictors decreases the error in the predictions.\n",

    "To visualize our results, we will create a scatter plot with Prize money on the y-axis and a predictor on the x-axis. Each predictor will be plotted separately with a coloured line that represents the predicted prize money from the model with that predictor only.\n"

    "We are expecting the older players with more experience (i.e played more seasons) to have a better rank and overall  leading to higher career earnings.
